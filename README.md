# Static Site Template

A static website template project using 11ty and Parcel so I can reuse it for my projects.

## TODO
- [ ] More consistent naming scheme for directories
- [ ] Instead of using {{ Content }} maybe use blocks includes https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35496514/nunjucks-blocks-defined-within-include-partial-file-ignored-by-extend
- [ ] Partials for footer / header etc
