# TODO

1. change .scss links into .css links
2. automatically generate .css files from .scss files, only in the build dir
3. compile ts into js
4. automatically change ts paths into js paths only in the build dir
5. parcel only the final build
6. Instead of using {{ Content }} maybe use blocks includes https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35496514/nunjucks-blocks-defined-within-include-partial-file-ignored-by-extend
7. Partials for footer / header etc

# Instead

1. define a shortcode to include files from static
